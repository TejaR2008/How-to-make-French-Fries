First, start by peeling the potatoes and wash them thoroughly. Then cut them into rectangular pieces into the size of your choice. Warm up the oil in a pan or a vessel. After some time when the oil is heated enough, put some of the potatoes that we cut earlier. Let it cook till they become golden brown. When done, serve hot on a plate and sprinkle some salt. Enjoy the delicious fries!
